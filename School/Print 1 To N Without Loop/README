Print numbers from 1 to N without the help of loops.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 10
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
Output: 1 2 3 4 5
 

Your Task:
This is a function problem. 
You only need to complete the function printNos() that takes N as parameter and prints number from 1 to N recursively. 
The driver code adds the newline automatically after the function call.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N) (Recursive).


Constraints:
1 <= N <= 990

** For More Input/Output Examples Use 'Expected Output' option **
