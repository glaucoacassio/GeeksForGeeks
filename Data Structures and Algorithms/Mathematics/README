You are given an interger I. You need to print the absolute value of the interger I.

Example 1:

Input:
I = -32
Output: 32
Explanation: The absolute value of -32 is 32.

Example 2:

Input:
I = 45
Output: 45

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Your task is to complete the function absolute() which takes an integer I as parameter and return the absolute value of I.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space : O(1)

Constraints:
-106 <= I <= 106
